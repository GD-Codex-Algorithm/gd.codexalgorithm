            <h2>Kinematic fleeing movement</h2>
            <h2> ROW 3</h2>
            <p>A kinematic fleeing algorithm is designed to determine the movement of a character based on its current position and orientation, with the goal of moving away from a threat. Unlike dynamic movement algorithms, which consider forces and acceleration, kinematic algorithms directly calculate the desired velocity to achieve a particular movement. The primary inputs for this algorithm are the character's current position and orientation, and the threat's position, while the output is the velocity vector that indicates the direction and speed of movement.

The kinematic flee behaviour is designed to move a character away from a threat. It requires the character's static data (current position) and the threat's static data (threat position) as inputs. The algorithm calculates the direction from the character to the threat and sets a velocity in the opposite direction. Orientation values are generally ignored.</p>
